# MathNet

Investigating the capabilities of neural networks to solve math problems and possible applications of pre-training on algebraic expressions.

## TODOs

- Try to avoid padding at output for simple arithmetic problems.
- Adjust loss function to ignore padding at output.
- Compute correct max input and output length for padding.
